Quick Start
-----------

This library is modelled roughly on concepts borrowed from Django's ORM.
There are some `examples`_ available in GitHub, but let's dive in
with an example that list all the available lights::

    from pprint import pprint
    from hueclient.api import hue_api
    from hueclient.models.light import Light

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        hue_api.authenticate_interactive(app_name='List Lights Example')

        for light in Light.objects.all():
            print(
                "Light {id} is named '{name}' and is {onoff} (brightness: {brightness})".format(
                    id=light.id,
                    name=light.name,
                    onoff='on' if light.state.on else 'off',
                    brightness=light.state.brightness,
                )
            )

Here is an example which blinks a specific light::

    from time import sleep
    from hueclient.api import hue_api
    from hueclient.models.light import Light

    # examples/blink_light.py
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # Make sure we are authenticated with the hue bridge.
        # You will be prompted if no username is found in ~/.python_hue
        hue_api.authenticate_interactive(app_name='Blink Light Example')

        # Get light ID 1
        light = Light.objects.get(id=1)

        # Loop forever
        while True:
            # Flip the on state from on -> off / off -> on
            light.state.on = not light.state.on

            # Save the state back to the bridge
            # (Note: required in order for your changes to take effect)

            light.state.save()

            # Pause here for a couple of seconds to create a slow blink
            # (Note: It is important to sleep here at least a little to
            # avoid overloading the bridge with API requests)
            sleep(2)
